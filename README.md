# HardReject
The idea is to create an application that helps young teams, start-up teams, small businesses or just enthusiasts to realize their projects. The application will fully track the progress of any project based on the terms of reference, allocated funds, the role of people in the team and their reporting. Statistics, adaptability to different needs. The prospects of this project are not only about automating teamwork, but also about going online, where everyone can share their projects with the public, find a team and attract investors.

Before starting, you need to install the database files "hardreject.sql" and "hard_reject_projects.sql", which are located in the project folder. To log in, enter (email: example@mail.ru) and (password: Abc123) in the authorization form.
